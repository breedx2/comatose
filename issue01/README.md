COMATOSE issue 01

An experimental examination and lo-fi showcase of
algorithmic, generative, and computer-based
works and technique.

COMATOSE provides free and open access to the code and resources used to

### SUBMISSIONS

COMATOSE welcomes your feedback. Please email letters, questions,
ideas, and contributions to comatose-zine@noisybox.net, or open an
issue in the github repository.

There is inspiration to be found in the vast infinite expanse
and in the infinitesimal minutiae! Challenge awaits at the interplay
of the two. Experiment, fail, learn, repeat. Break things and
make things!

Thank you for spending time with this production.

POOR VECTOR

The poor, neglected vector. The vector is such a powerful tool, but
it is often overlooked by digital artists. The power of vector graphics
originates from its representation as pure mathematical construct (a
line going from here to there, a circle with this diameter, a box filled
with that color, maybe even a curve). Contrast that with raster images (bitmaps),
that just put it all out there -- "Here's a gazillion pixels and all
the colors". Sure, pretty easy for OUR brains to understand, but where's
the sophistication?

In contemporary desktop computing environments, fonts and many desktop icons
are built with vector graphics. The mathematical formulas behind the vectors
allow a rendering engine to show them at any size with no compromise in quality.
This is why fonts in a web browser can scale smoothly, but when you zoom
in on a raster image it begins to look pixelated and disgusting.
No pixelation with vector images!

The most common formats for vector images are postscript ( / hot methods??.ps or .eps),
PDF (portable document format), or SVG (scalable vector graphics). SVG
is widely supported on the web and there are many tools to support creation
and manipulation of svg files. d3.js is all over the web for data visualization,
and popular creative coding environments like Processing and p5.js have
some amount of support for reading/creating/writing SVG files (yet
the common tutorials/examples don't spend much time on this).

So why aren't there more creative uses of svg in the algorithmic
and generative art world? I'm still not sure. Perhaps it is complexity,
perhaps it is tooling support. Maybe people just don't care, and plain
old fashioned images are just good enough.  

There definitely exists prior art around the exploration of svg as a target
format...so this isn't exactly new. For example, Mike Brondbjerg has built
somewhat cubist (triangulist?) portraits of American presidents using algorithms
and processing. Joshua Davis uses vectors in his artful corporate commissions.
There are other examples to be found, but the vast majority of svg work
seems to be making flashy graphics for the web or for corporate/brand design.

Perhaps the use is more widespread than we realize, and many creators simply
do not discuss their technique for philosophical/ideological reasons (form over
technique, aesthetic over method). I am skeptical of this. I think that
the vector is ignored or underutilized due to the reasons above, but
also for its sterility. Its smooth, perfect lines are often too clean,
too flawless. In its robotic cleanliness, its infinite scalability, the
vector's power is also its downfall.

Our eyes, our minds, they seek out and gravitate toward the flawed. Razor
sharp symmetry is a novelty whose interest quickly fades. Can we have it
both ways?
